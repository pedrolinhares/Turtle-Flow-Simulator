Quick guide to build library for Windows 64bit.

1. What you need

 a. Windows Server 2003 or later
 b. PGI compiler for Windows
 c. Cygwin environment
 d. Microsoft Visual Studio (lib.exe is required to create dll)

2. Modifying Makefile.rule

 You have to define "C_COMPILER = PGI" in Makefile.rule. You can customize
 other options whichever you like.

3. Do "make libs"

 Since Cygwin shell script is extremely slow, compiling will take over
 2 hours.

4. Making DLL

 a. Go to exports directory
 b. Type "make dll"

Good luck
